## Notes

1. [Blockchain Basics](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html): Some intuition.
2. [Fallback function](../master/fallback.md): Explaining fallback function.

## Tutorials

1. [First contract](../master/firstContract.sol): Implement simple contract.

2. [Inheritance](../master/Inheritance.sol): Basic inheritance in Solidity.

3. [Modifiers and Exception Handling](../master/CustomModifiersErrorHandling.sol): Modifiers and Exception handling in a contract.

4. [Import Libraries](../master/ImportLibraries.sol): How to import libraries from [library.sol](../blob/master/library.sol).

5. [Transaction](../master/transaction.sol): Event logging and information about transaction. Try to send 1 ether with the valid address.

6. [Account Info](../master/accountInfo.sol): Checking the account balance and information.

7. [Subcurrency](../master/subCurrency): The simplest form of a cryptocurrency. Generating coins out of thin air, but only the person that created the contract will be able to do that. Furthermore, anyone can send coins to each other without any need for registering with username and password - all you need is an Ethereum keypair. 

8. [ERC20]():
